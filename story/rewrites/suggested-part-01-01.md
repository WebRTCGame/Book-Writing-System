# Suggested rewrite — part-01-01

Target: story/parts/part-01-01.md (opening beat)

Summary: Tighten sentences, increase immediate tension in opening lines, preserve POV (char-sam), and avoid adding new facts. Aim to raise word-level tension and hit the chapter tone 'tense, atmospheric'.

Suggested edits:
- Make the opening line more active and immediate.
- Replace passive descriptions with character sensory details (sound, touch).
- Remove any extraneous exposition; fold facts into action/dialogue.

Example (draft):
> The corridor lights threw sharp bands across the hull plating. Sam paused, feeling the hull's faint shudder underfoot, and listened — not for engines now, but for something missing.
