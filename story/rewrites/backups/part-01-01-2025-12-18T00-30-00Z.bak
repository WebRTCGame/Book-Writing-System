The corridor smells of hot metal and old ozone; even at rest the ship carries a sound like the distant pulse of a heartbeat. Sam kept his palm flat on the rail and let his toes find a rhythm on the grated floor as they moved toward the bridge. He'd been awake for hours, scanning logs and re-running reconciliations, but in the quiet, every small inconsistency felt like a different kind of danger.

A thin halo of blue light from the hull displays painted patterns over his forearms. On the screen, a signal trace pulsed and died, leaving a faint residue of data like footprints on a beach. Sam nudged the feed, isolating the carrier frequency, and frowned: someone had stripped time stamps and re-sent segments so carefully they almost read like an intentional lullaby. He could feel the shape of it in his hands — the way silence leaned into the space where data should be.

He tapped a note to Aya and to SAM: "Found strippedsync on channel 3. Suggest deep-compare on registry and probe archives. Mark private until corroboration." The message felt formal and small next to the emptiness around him. He waited, finger hovering over the send, and then hit it.

A soft chirp answered. SAM returned a diagnostic summary: "Candidate anomaly identified. Probability: 84% manual tampering. Recommend on-site verification before broadcast." Sam leaned back against the rail and let out a breath. He had seen this before — the deliberate erasure, the surgical silence that came before someone wanted to hide a truth.

He felt a presence behind him and half-turned. Lyra stood in the doorway, her hair pinned back, eyes tired but sharp. "You found something?" she asked.

Sam nodded. "Someone's been cleaning the records. Time stamps missing; a pattern of removed segments. It's focused, like someone is pruning a tree to make the hollowed core invisible."

Lyra's jaw tightened. "Keep it in the queue. Let Aya and Elya vet it first. If it's deliberate, we don't want to make waves until we know what we're looking at."

They set to work in quiet coordination — two hands on a console, two minds triangulating possibilities. The light of late hours sharpened their edges; small jokes were swallowed into professional focus. Outside, a distant star gave a pale wink that could have been coincidence. Sam couldn't tell anymore.

By the time they had a coherent fragment, the file showed a vector toward an old mining outpost near a mapped but rarely used corridor. The coordinates were old; someone had masked the departures and arrivals to keep it hidden. That masked pattern — that quiet — felt like an invitation and a threat.

Sam copied the fragment to a secure cache, flagged it private, and added a short note: "If this is a beacon, it's been cleaned. Bring only core team for verification." He set the queue latch and let the ship hum around him. Even in a ship full of people, a secret could be as lonely as a single light blinking in the dark.
