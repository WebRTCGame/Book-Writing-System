Chapter 6 — Threads and Traces

The Ark's logs at first read like a drumming: minor irregularities only, a set of timestamps offset by thin margins, a few maintenance pings republished with different labels. Sam's eyes had been on that pattern for hours, and the more he traced those ghostly echoes, the more they braided into a single, patient hand. Whoever had cleaned the outpost's traces had not acted in one place alone.

They began in the catalog — Elya pushing a small barrage of cross-queries through archival caches while Lyra monitored the live feeds for anything that seemed to reshape the old signals. Elya's analyzer pried at the metadata and found telltale fingerprints: edited packet headers, subtle packet replays spaced to look like scheduled maintenance, and a persistent use of a private key scheme that didn't match any of the Ark's known contractors.

"They're careful," Elya said. "They're cleaning the connective tissue of these traces; it's not just 'hide the outpost', it's 'erase the traces so that any map of this sector will be wrong.'"

That analysis demanded a different approach — one that favored patience and small sample gathering over dramatic confrontation. They staged covert probes to the coordinates suggested by the outpost fragment, collecting environmental telemetry and pinging for any passive listening devices. The responses were, when they came, faint and almost apologetic: a small echo here, a microburst there, all arranged to look accidental.

On the ship's whiteboard, Aya drew a cluster that reminded her of a comb — long teeth with tiny notches that suggested a sweep. Each notch was a cleaned record. It looked like a methodical effort to make certain corridors appear unused, to redirect attention away from a lattice of activity.

Over the next few days they followed the threads by night, slipping small teams into the lattice on private missions and pulling back data. Each mission returned pieces: a scrubbed flight manifest with a single line apparently left to mislead, a set of container manifests with chemical tags removed, and one, unexpectedly human thing — a child's drawing tucked into a drawer in a science module. The drawing bothered them more than the rest. It implied at least temporary habitation and someone who had wanted to humanize a place they were cleaning.

Sam found a data fragment that matched the child's drawing against an archival registry. It led to a technician who'd been reassigned years earlier. The transfers showed a pattern of relocation and then silence. Someone had moved people out, cleaned the places they left, and, crucially, carefully handled the paper trail.

The team grew quieter as the pattern revealed itself: these were not mere tidy-ups; they were surgical edits of history. Whoever arranged this had motive and the tools to make an entire sector's story disappear. The implication charged the crew with urgency — not only to find the missing pieces but to keep what they found in a place that couldn't be edited after them.

Late in a watch, Sam brought the latest rough map to Aya. "If we stitch the fragments, we might be able to find where the records converge," he said. "And if we can find their origin node, maybe we can find people who know what happened."

Aya nodded, tired but resolute. "We patch what we can. We keep the net small and the seams tight."

As they moved through the lattice of cleaned histories, another fact grew sharp and a little frightening: this wasn't only about one outpost. It was about a system that could rewrite experience by making it vanish from the logs. Deception on that scale had consequences that went beyond missing ships. It meant entire narratives — human narratives — could be erased.

They decided to do the slow work: document, preserve, and outpace the erasure by creating a record that could not easily be modified. It was a small, stubborn act of memory against a force that preferred forgetting.
