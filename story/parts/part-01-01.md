The corridor lights threw sharp bands across the hull plating. Sam kept his palm on the rail and moved toward the bridge with a steady, measured gait; he'd been awake for hours, and every small inconsistency in the logs felt like a new hazard.

On the screen a trace pulsed, then died — a hollowed-out signature with time stamps ripped away. Sam isolated the carrier and frowned: the segments had been re-sent so cleanly they read like an invitation to look away. He tagged the fragment private and sent a short note to Aya and Elya: "Found cleaned beacon—recommend deep-compare and private triage."

SAM chirped back with a terse diagnostic: "Candidate anomaly: 84% probability manual tampering. Recommend on-site verification." Sam let the breath out that had been caught behind his teeth. This was not careless error.

Lyra came up behind him without a word, eyes sharp in the glow. "You found something?"

"Cleaned timestamps, targeted segments," Sam said. "If it's a beacon, someone's made sure no one will find it by accident."

They worked in a quiet rhythm, triangulating the vector until the fragment resolved into coordinates — an old mining outpost off a seldom-traveled corridor. The data had been masked and re-labeled; whatever had gone on there had been made thin and neat so it could be hidden.

Sam copied the fragment to a secure cache and flagged it private. "If this is a beacon, bring only the core team," he wrote. The ship hummed on, indifferent to the single light that had started this small and dangerous question.
