Dr. Elya Chen was smaller than Aya expected, with careful hands and the kind of quiet voice that made complicated things sound like obvious steps. When Aya and Samir brought the residue and the compressed packet to the observatory lab, she accepted the data with a nod and the faint indulgence of someone who knew the weight of small proofs.

"You did the right thing by isolating the frames," Elya said, eyes on the spectral lenses perched like tiny magnifiers on her nose. "If someone is pruning, they'll re-index in ways that smear origin notes. We have to triangulate by the reply."

She fed the residues into her local spectral lattice and then into a small heuristic routine that layered the prime-interval timing over vector residues. Samir hovered, hands occasionally finding the edge of a console as if touch would help keep his thoughts steady. Elya worked with an almost domestic calm, hands translating ticks into maps.

"What do you see?" Aya asked.

Elya didn't look up. "There are harmonics in the low-frequency envelope—harmonics that hold spatial aliases. The prime intervals are carriers; the low harmonics are the language within them. Whoever tuned this knows how to hide voice within silence."

She ran the heuristic twice, then once more with a tighter envelope. The console produced a faint directional vector: a small arc of sky relative to their current heading, not a precise fix but a coarse bearing. A faint probe fragment's telemetry trace smoothed into resolution: the micro signature matched the probe-frag-01 class found in archived hazard logs, an obscure class of low-power directional handers.

"A probe," Samir breathed. "Not a passive beacon. A device answering an invitation."

Elya's mouth thinned. "Or a callback," she said. The difference mattered: invitation meant someone offered contact; callback suggested someone had already been signalled. Either was problematic; both suggested prior knowledge.

"Can we decode content?" Aya asked. "Is there a message?"

Elya hesitated. She ran an analysis sketch that searched for redundancy and symbolic repetition. Certain frames repeated a small code-block rhythm that when plotted against prime timing suggested a set of simple bit-mappings. It wasn't a sentence. It was a signature: an ID, or a class marker, or a way to say 'I am here'. There was no overt semantic content—no human-syntax—but the signature's structure implied control and intent.

"It's not a language we can translate into words," Elya said. "It's an identity signature with a direction. The content says: 'Object at vector X: call-reply appended.' The underlying structure, though, looks engineered—organization-level. Someone with resources designed the handshake, not an opportunist."

"Resources means someone with access," Samir said. "Or someone who can hide resources under a common label."

Elya tapped a small diagram onto the console and turned it toward them. The vector arc intersected with a map segment marked as uncharted in their current charts: the lattice sector. It was a confirmation, more than a direction. The signature used by the probe belonged to a class that had been catalogued once and then scrubbed from public tables. Aya recognized the feeling: someone had chosen not just to hide a thing but to control who could see that hiding.

"Who would have the capability to seed a probe and hide the trace?" Aya asked.

Elya's hand hovered. "A non-state actor with access to low-orbit deploy tech, or an institutional program that values secrecy. Or an external group that treats navigational datasets as a strategic resource."

The tone of the room shifted. Where there had been quiet curiosity, tension tightened like a wire. Outside, the ship's polite notice about the handshake had not gone away. If command or a higher authority had placed a watch process in the archives, they could intercept and sanitize evidence before it attracted external attention. That meant someone could contain knowledge between ship and higher echelons.

"Captain Ahn should know," Samir said, and the sentence hung heavy. If the captain was in the loop, then the problem moved up an institutional ladder; if not, then the captain might be the audience they'd have to persuade. Either way, there were risks.

Elya's eyes held a small, principled light. "If you go to command, you'll trigger a chain. If command is the controller, they'll bury it and reframe it as a security imperative. If command isn't aware, you'll have to prove it without exposing the crew to panic. Both roads carry danger."

Aya thought of the archival pruning and felt the ship tighten. There was another factor, less scientific and more social: if they told a larger part of the crew, there was the risk of leaks, rumors, and fear that might make the captain clamp down. If they kept the data tight, they risked being framed as conspirators if anything leaked.

Samir's jaw set. "We need corroboration: more probes or a better fix on that vector. We need someone with off-ship reach to independently log the probe signature."

Elya nodded and added a practical step: "I'll push a discrete, low-band ping in the vector arc at minimal power to try and coax a repeat handshake. If the probe replies, we get more data. If it's silent, we have to interpret what silence means."

"Do it," Aya said. She felt the gravity of taking a step that would actively solicit a reply—an invitation to cross lines it might be prudent to leave alone. But the alternative was inertia: leaving a thing someone wanted hidden to remain hidden.

Elya worked with gentle concentration. She programmed a brief probe-nudge: low-power, phase-synchronized, masked as routine calibration. The observatory's dome opened just enough for the sensors to sweep the arc, the array humming with soft compliance. The ping slid outward like a careful hand reaching into a dark pocket.

For a long minute nothing returned but background stellar noise. Then the array registered a trace: a faint directional echo that matched the arc and echoed the prime timing. The response was modest, a courteous little tick at odd intervals. But it answered—the lattice's curtain had stirred.

Elya's fingers trembled a little as she read the stream. "It's an answer," she said. "Not a message yet, but confirmation. The probe recognized our touch."

Samir exhaled. Aya felt both relief and unease; relief because there was now more to analyze; unease because a reply meant their ping had been noticed and catalogued. A log would appear somewhere, and someone somewhere would take note.

"Keep this between us for now," Elya said. "I'll catalogue everything, but we'll need better corroboration before involving command."

They agreed. The lab hummed; the observatory recorded micro-samples into a lockbox they encrypted together. There was now motive enough and equipment enough to make a case, but making the case and surviving the aftermath were different things.

When they left the lab the ship's neutral notice about the handshake still hung in the background like a polite reminder. Outside, stars were indifferent and yet the tiny probe's reply had made a stripe of meaning in the dark. Aya kept the image of the prime pulses in her head—two, three, five, seven—and wondered whose voice it really was, and who had efforted to make that voice disappear.
