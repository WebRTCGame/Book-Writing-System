<!-- Applied rewrite iteration 1: tightened opening and raised immediate stakes -->
The observatory smelled of ozone and a dry hush. Aya and Samir moved like two people who knew silence could hide a crime. The cached frames, when they came, were polite and patched—but underneath, a rhythm tapped insistently: 2,3,5,7. It was not random; it had intent.

"Primes," Samir said. "Someone's knocking in a language we can read."

Aya leaned closer to the spectral lattice. The timing wasn't just a signature; it pointed. A faint vectorarity threaded the residue—an orientation embedded in the rhythm. Whoever sent it had left a direction, not merely a presence.

"We're being pointed at something," Aya said, voice low. "This isn't accidental. It has purpose."

Samir's fingers moved quick and sure, pulling residues into a map. "If it's a probe calling back, it's either an invitation or a trap. Either way, it's active."

The lab hummed. The quiet shifted from observation to consequence. They had not simply recovered frames; they had found a caller with an arrow. That changed the game.
