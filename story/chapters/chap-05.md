# Chapter 5 — The Outpost

The outpost was not what the archive photos had promised. In still frames it looked like a minor industrial archipelago — a few decks of corrugated metal, an antenna scarred by micrometeoroids, a sparse landing pad that had seen better days. Up close, it felt like the place had been unmade with a deliberate hand. Every hatch that opened into a work area showed tidy abandon: instruments in storage racks but stripped of sensitive modules, carefully labelled crates with 'disposal' stickers, and maintenance logs that read like a fiction carefully redacted.

Aya guided the recon drone by the soft glow of the console, while Sam and Lyra took separate feeds and cross-checked timestamps. The first images were almost anticlimactic — a table with a set of tools, a coffee mug with a chip on its rim — and yet the way the log files had been touched raised a disturbance more than the missing hardware. Someone had been careful to make the place readable as abandonment, but the markings were too precise to be accidental.

They made a quiet plan to enter the sealed maintenance chamber. Elya insisted they strip down to core, leave back-up cameras, and collect only evidence that could be reassembled without contaminating a scene. "We aren't salvagers," she told them. "We’re archivists with reason to be suspicious."

Inside the chamber the air was cool, the surface of floor metallic and faintly grooved from the passage of tools and carts. A small console had been wiped, but under inspection they found the faint residue of a patch file — reduced, stripped, and then re-submitted to the network as a routine update. It had been coaxed to look like a diagnostic when in truth it held a small handshake that would have called a probe back to a secreted port.

The implication hit them with the cold weight of deliberate craft: someone wanted to hide the presence of an outbound device and make its disappearance coherent with normal upkeep. That level of manipulation required planning and access to systems that assumed compliance from on-site personnel.

They took photographs, recorded telemetry, and stored a private fragment of the handshake. Later, back aboard the Ark, they ran a cross-correlation and found an odd coincidence: similar edited fingerprints appeared in other, unrelated maintenance logs across the sector. It looked like a single actor — or a compact network of actors — keeping a pattern clean.

They called a private meeting with the captain and the smallest group of trusted officers. "We can't make accusations without proof," Aya said, "but we have a vector and a method. Whoever is doing this is capable and careful."

"Keep it quiet for now," the Captain said. "We don't want to tip off whoever did this. But document everything and keep a source-of-truth cache. When there's enough to act on, we'll decide whether to inform others."

That evening, as the Ark drifted a slow course away from the outpost and into deeper patchwork of mapped corridors, each of them replayed the day's small discoveries. None of the fragments proved who had taken them, but together they made a map of omissions that felt like a negative of something deliberate. That map would be the Ark's work; it would be the thread they followed into the lattice and whatever secrets were kept there.
