Samir walked with his hands in his pockets the way people do when the conversation is dangerous to say aloud. "We can hand this up to command," he said, because a practical man frames options as operations. "Let them see what was removed."

Aya closed her eyes and felt the ship flick its instruments like a polite hostess. "And if 'command' is the one doing the removing?" she asked. It was not a hypothetical. The archival audits had a smell to them — a bureaucratic neatness that erased more than it admitted. If command had instructed a scrub, a report could be smoothed out of existence like an edit.

Samir's jaw worked. "Then we copy and hide. We make it a thing somebody has to un-ignore."

They moved to a maintenance corridor, the air colder here, the lighting utilitarian. A maintenance hatch slipped open under Samir's fingertip and the smell of ozone touched Aya's nose. He rooted through a bag and handed her a shoveled microdrive and a small toolkit: a discreet way to bridge an offline copy to a secure, human-readable location. "If the ship's watch prunes in real time it can still wipe online copies," Samir said. "Offline is stubborn."

Aya slid the microdrive into the vault of her jacket. The drive was small enough to be swallowed by a palm but held enough redundancy to make an old technician proud. "How stubborn?" she asked.

"Stubborn enough," he said. "But we need a place others will trust. A secure node outside ship net, or someone with a physical copy off-board."

They talked through a plan that was low-tech where it needed to be — paper as audit, encoded drives as evidence, and human messengers as redundancy. That old rule had been taught to Aya when she was a trainee: technology can be audited, but people remember in ways code can't always scrub. It was not romantic; it was tactical.

Samir tapped a pad and pulled up a maintenance diagram, showing a route through cable channels that bypassed most of the ship's primary monitoring nodes. "We go blind for a minute in that stretch," he said. "No cameras, less logging, and plenty of physical conduit to drop a drive through."

The route would take them close to the archival core's service ducts — the same core that had returned empty authorization fields. Aya felt the gravity of it: they were planning a small act of defiance that could be framed as criminal or heroic depending on outcome.

"What's the risk of detection?" she asked.

Samir was honest. "Medium. The watch can correlate timestamps with last-known authorized moves. If we do it during a low-ops window and spoof a maintenance ticket, it looks like routine work."

"What about Captain?" Aya asked. "If this gets out, and it's under a captain's nose, we die on some bureaucratic hill."

"Then it's a hill worth dying on," Samir said, and the words were not light. He had seen people disappeared by policy before; his iron bluntness concealed a deeper fear that he kept to himself. "We do it smart."

That evening they moved as a pair of technicians on a mission that required both courage and dull hands. Samir laid tracks for a maintenance ticket, forged in a way that left a plausible reading for system audits; Aya cached the microdrive in her implant's buffer and made an encrypted duplicate that only she and Samir could unlock. They slid through service hatches like ghosts.

At the archival core, the observatory's vault sat with sterile dignity — tidy racks and a single root console that shimmered with a cursor. The core's environmental lights hummed softly and the whole place smelled of ozone and old metal. Samir ducked under an access panel and threaded a feed to a derated diagnostic path that bypassed certain audit hooks. It was an ugly, effective solution: a manual bridge.

"Ready?" Samir whispered, voice low in the metal hush.

"Aye," Aya said. She keyed a short pattern on her implant and offered the microdrive. It slid into the root slot with a soft mechanical breath.

They watched a series of handshakes flicker across the console — polite checks, heartbeats, and a thin line of denial that spat up the null `AUTHORIZED` field. Then, a tick no human hands had made: the console's cursor blinked and a process nested itself into a readout. It was neither a simple monitor nor a passive log: the watch process nested a removal thread that quietly re-indexed and re-wrote entries into neutralized form.

Samir's jaw hardened. "A pruning daemon," he said. "It doesn't just hide. It comes in and rewrites indexes so later queries can't find what was chosen."

"Someone programmed the ship's memory not to remember certain things," Aya said. The implications sat heavy. A system that pruned memory was a system that could enforce narratives.

They executed the copy. The microdrive filled with compressed frames, telemetry, and a small but stubborn sequence that matched the prime intervals Aya had noticed. Samir made a small checksum printout — old tech printed on thermal strip — and fed the microdrive into an insulated container he'd carried in his jacket. Then they left as they'd come: hatches, clumsy footsteps, plausible maintenance traces.

When they reached the transit corridor, an unexpected gentle chime rose through the ship's network: an official notice that read with calm words.

"NOTICE: External beacon handshake detected. Please stand by for authorized diagnosis."

Aya felt the ship note them — not angry, not accusing, but aware. The message was general, but timing was everything. Just as they sealed the insulated drive and moved to a less monitored channel, her implant emitted a soft diagnostic whisper: a trace of handshake residues, encoded in a way that suggested deliberate intent rather than random telemetry.

"Prime intervals," she murmured. "Someone knocked. We answered."

Samir's face went flat. "We answered quietly," he said. "But they answered back." There was the sound in his voice of a door closing and another opening at the same time.

Aya's mind ticked forward: someone had left a marker, then someone had chosen to remove the marker from public memory, and the marker had chosen to speak back. The little knot of events made a new problem: the beacon wasn't inert; it responded. And someone — people, machines, policy — had arranged for that response to be selectively hidden.

They walked on toward a maintenance node where they could send the encrypted checksum to a trustworthy off-board contact, deciding to keep the microdrive physically close until they knew who could be trusted. The job they had done was small and fragile: a copy of an absence, an argument against forgetting.

When they parted ways in the dim corridors, both of them felt the quiet of the ship settle like snow. What they'd taken would matter, but the question of who else knew and who had set the watch would not go away. The ship would remember them in the logs it kept, but they hoped that the copies under their control would keep a memory someone else might need.
