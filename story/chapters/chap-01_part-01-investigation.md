<!-- Applied rewrite iteration 1: tightened prose and increased early tension -->
Aya woke to the hydroponics alarm like cold water in her lungs. The fern troughs flashed emergency blue; her implant flickered where the Orion sector should be — a clean, clinical blank that felt intentional.

She touched the ceramic compass at her jacket, a small talisman. The overlay read: UNSYNCED / OBSERVATORY‑LOCKED. Not an error. A seam had been sealed.

"Sam?" she called. He came from the engineering bay with grease on his gloves, expression set to business. "Comms loop sealed to public ops," he said. "Higher priv only. You find something?"

"A sliver of map's gone between forty-seven and forty-nine. I saw a pulse — like someone knocking — but no log." She tapped her implant; it blinked, reluctant to show the missing piece.

Samir punched open a service panel; the observatory root log returned an empty `AUTHORIZED` field — a polite hole. "Deliberate," he said.

They moved with practiced silence. Aya's implant logged a low-res breadcrumb trail into a private buffer: a ritual she trusted. The cached frames came back patched and polite, headers masked. Hidden frames held a stubborn rhythm — two, three, five, seven — prime intervals, deliberate and directional.

"Someone left a marker, then smeared the context," Aya said. "We copy what we can and make the record stubborn."

Samir nodded. He bridged a microdrive and began a slow, surgical copy. They encrypted the drive with a quick key and tucked it into a padded container. When the last frame copied, the console flickered: a monitoring handshake that felt watching.

"It's watching," Samir said. "There's a nested pruning process — it erases traces at a deeper index."

Aya felt the implication like a cold seam: a system taught to forget. She set her jaw. "Then we make sure something remembers," she said.
