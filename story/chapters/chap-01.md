# Orion Ark — Chapter 1: Blank Sector

<!-- Part 1 — Blank Sector (Investigation) -->
Aya woke to the hydroponics alarm like she'd swallowed a pocket of cold space. The fern troughs along the wall flashed their emergency blue; condensation bead-rolled down the polyglass and the soft hum of recirculation turned thin with the ship's sudden attention. Her left-eye implant stuttered, a teal pupil spasming as a rectangle where the Orion sector should have been went unlit — a clean, clinical blank.

For a second the ship felt like it broke a bone and then hid the ache. She kept her hand on the ceramic compass at her jacket, not to navigate but to anchor. The overlay read UNSYNCED / OBSERVATORY‑LOCKED. Clinical. Quiet. Deliberate. Aya had seen system glitches before; this had the feel of a seam someone had stitched shut.

"Sam?" she called. Her voice left the corridor with the humid smell of soil and the metallic tang of old machinery. The corridor lights were low and patient; out here in the hab decks, motion was recorded and interpreted even if no one was watching. Samir stepped from the engineering bay with the damp prints of grease on his gloves and a face that folded into business before it could show worry. He moved like someone who measured every risk; that measured way of moving meant his worry was usually a matter of facts rather than panic.

"Comms loop's sealed to public ops," he said. "Higher priv only. You find something?"

"A sliver of the map's gone," Aya said. "Between grid lines forty-seven and forty-nine. I saw an intermittent pulse in the telemetry overlay — like someone was knocking — but the log didn't return anything."

Samir kicked a service panel open with the toe of his boot and the observatory access terminal flashed polite denial. The root log returned an empty `AUTHORIZED` field: a hole in the ledger that read like an intentional absence.

"That's not a glitch," he said. "That's deliberate."

They read the face of the ship around them: fans, pumps, the small, endless breath of a habitat module designed to be forgetful only of nothing. Aya felt a scratch of cold at the base of her skull — not fear exactly, more the recognition that some people trained systems to forget.

"Who would have access to scrub a sector?" she asked, watching the teal pupil in her implant blink as if the ship itself were reluctant to meet her eye.

"Command, external liaison nodes, maybe someone with a buried token," Samir said, clicking at the terminal. He was always a practicalist; naming options didn't make him melodramatic, it just gave him leverage. "Or an automated chain that pruned anomalies. Either way, removing something from a map is a decision."

Aya found herself thinking of small battles she'd had with institutional data before — the quiet bureaucratic erasures that became a kind of cloud in people's lives. Once, on a freighter route, she'd pried open a supposedly corrupted log and found minutes and names that had been smoothed out like sand.

"Check the observatory cache," she said. "If someone scrubbed in the archive, there may still be cached frames. Cameras and telemetry don't always get the memo."

Samir frowned. "Frames are partitioned. The access logs show an audit scrubbed for authorized reads. We'll need to ladder up auth or brute a microdrive."

Brute-force was a word that tasted of compromised doors and whispered confidences. Aya felt the compass heavy against her ribs. The pulse she had seen — it was not like background stellar noise. It had a pattern, a cadence that clung to the corner of her implant's decompressor: short tuple intervals. Twice, three times, a five, then seven. Prime intervals. Deliberate. Not accidental background drift.

"Whoever pinged that sector did it in a way that wanted attention," she said. "Primes feel like a knock: human or intelligent, not random."

Samir chewed his lip. "Then someone wanted to be found in a particular way — or someone wanted that signal off the books. Either way, it raises a hand."

They moved through the ship with the practiced economy of people who'd learned when silence could be weaponized. Aya's implant recorded low-resolution telemetry into its buffer, a private breadcrumb trail she kept for herself. The ship's scanners labeled most of their movements as innocuous; on record they were two crew performing a maintenance probe. Off record, Aya thought, they were two people checking the seams of a world someone might be sewing shut.

Outside the observatory dome the stars were indifferent: clean, distant pinpricks behind the polyglass. But the dome itself had a tension, a sense that the ship kept its eye on that patch of space and chose what to remember. Aya crouched at the access terminal, the console's cursor a patient pixel. The cache it offered back was polite and patchy — snapshots with masked headers and hedged timestamps. Somebody had made efforts to make certain frames private in ways the system didn't bother to lie about. They left the absence visible.

"We'll copy what we can," Samir said. "Microdrive, offline copy. If there's a watch process they'll notice, but an offline copy goes somewhere they can't prune in real time."

Aya's hands went to the microdrive in her pocket — a small, hand-carved thing that fit her palm like a withheld secret. She thought of how easy it would be to make a record stubborn, to tuck it out of sight where only a human could find it later. It was almost a ritual: two people copying what another had tried to forget.

She felt a flicker of something like dread — not for herself, but for the record itself. If maps and logs could be chosen to vanish, then who decided which memories were acceptable? The ship's record was, in some way, public life; choices to hide things were small political acts with consequences.

Samir's fingers moved quick and sure, a surgeon at a console. He peeled protocol layers back, pulled cached frames into a buffer, and began the slow ritual of saving. The frames came up as artifacts: raw telemetry, stuttering camera snapshots, and a stubborn rhythm within the noise that clicked against Aya's implant decompressor. The prime pattern was there like a stub of code, a small deliberate heartbeat sitting under the ship's static.

"Someone marked this," Aya whispered. "And then buried the marker."

Samir's expression hardened. "Then we bury a backup," he said. "And then we find who doesn't want us having it."

As they worked, the observatory hummed its normal low hum. Aya felt, for a breath, the ship noticing them — a polite ping, a monitoring handshake that didn't have the shape of hostility, just the clinical attention of systems doing their job. She saved the frames to the microdrive and encrypted them with a quick key — a private stitch anyone could cut if they had the right token.

The operation was quiet and deft, a choreography of two people who trusted each other's hands more than they trusted the logs at the center of the ship. When the last frame copied, Samir slid the microdrive into his vest. There was a thin almost inaudible sound — the ship's AI querying a monitor, checking the health and authorization of the archive. The console flickered.

"It's watching," Samir said, voice low. "Not just logs. A watch process nested in the archive. That's why `AUTHORIZED` came back blank — a higher-order filter."

"A watcher that prunes and reclaims," Aya said. "Someone doesn't want us to have the name of who flagged it."

They finished the copies and exited the archive like two people who had left fingerprints on a safe. Aya kept the image of that blank square on her implant and the memory of those prime ticks. Whoever had sent the knock had used a simple, human-seeming language. Whoever scrubbed the records had done it in a way that left the blank obvious — a challenge or a warning.

As they moved back through the ship, Aya felt the knowledge bending the space between her and simple objectives. A small deletion on a star chart had become a shape with teeth. The first thing they'd done was take a copy. The second would be to learn who had reason to make a map forget.

<!-- Part 2 — Bypass (Decision & Action) -->
Samir walked with his hands in his pockets the way people do when the conversation is dangerous to say aloud. "We can hand this up to command," he said, because a practical man frames options as operations. "Let them see what was removed."

Aya closed her eyes and felt the ship flick its instruments like a polite hostess. "And if 'command' is the one doing the removing?" she asked. It was not a hypothetical. The archival audits had a smell to them — a bureaucratic neatness that erased more than it admitted. If command had instructed a scrub, a report could be smoothed out of existence like an edit.

Samir's jaw worked. "Then we copy and hide. We make it a thing somebody has to un-ignore."

They moved to a maintenance corridor, the air colder here, the lighting utilitarian. A maintenance hatch slipped open under Samir's fingertip and the smell of ozone touched Aya's nose. He rooted through a bag and handed her a shoveled microdrive and a small toolkit: a discreet way to bridge an offline copy to a secure, human-readable location. "If the ship's watch prunes in real time it can still wipe online copies," Samir said. "Offline is stubborn."

Aya slid the microdrive into the vault of her jacket. The drive was small enough to be swallowed by a palm but held enough redundancy to make an old technician proud. "How stubborn?" she asked.

"Stubborn enough," he said. "But we need a place others will trust. A secure node outside ship net, or someone with a physical copy off-board."

They talked through a plan that was low-tech where it needed to be — paper as audit, encoded drives as evidence, and human messengers as redundancy. That old rule had been taught to Aya when she was a trainee: technology can be audited, but people remember in ways code can't always scrub. It was not romantic; it was tactical.

Samir tapped a pad and pulled up a maintenance diagram, showing a route through cable channels that bypassed most of the ship's primary monitoring nodes. "We go blind for a minute in that stretch," he said. "No cameras, less logging, and plenty of physical conduit to drop a drive through."

The route would take them close to the archival core's service ducts — the same core that had returned empty authorization fields. Aya felt the gravity of it: they were planning a small act of defiance that could be framed as criminal or heroic depending on outcome.

"What's the risk of detection?" she asked.

Samir was honest. "Medium. The watch can correlate timestamps with last-known authorized moves. If we do it during a low-ops window and spoof a maintenance ticket, it looks like routine work."

"What about Captain?" Aya asked. "If this gets out, and it's under a captain's nose, we die on some bureaucratic hill."

"Then it's a hill worth dying on," Samir said, and the words were not light. He had seen people disappeared by policy before; his iron bluntness concealed a deeper fear that he kept to himself. "We do it smart."

That evening they moved as a pair of technicians on a mission that required both courage and dull hands. Samir laid tracks for a maintenance ticket, forged in a way that left a plausible reading for system audits; Aya cached the microdrive in her implant's buffer and made an encrypted duplicate that only she and Samir could unlock. They slid through service hatches like ghosts.

At the archival core, the observatory's vault sat with sterile dignity — tidy racks and a single root console that shimmered with a cursor. The core's environmental lights hummed softly and the whole place smelled of ozone and old metal. Samir ducked under an access panel and threaded a feed to a derated diagnostic path that bypassed certain audit hooks. It was an ugly, effective solution: a manual bridge.

"Ready?" Samir whispered, voice low in the metal hush.

"Aye," Aya said. She keyed a short pattern on her implant and offered the microdrive. It slid into the root slot with a soft mechanical breath.

They watched a series of handshakes flicker across the console — polite checks, heartbeats, and a thin line of denial that spat up the null `AUTHORIZED` field. Then, a tick no human hands had made: the console's cursor blinked and a process nested itself into a readout. It was neither a simple monitor nor a passive log: the watch process nested a removal thread that quietly re-indexed and re-wrote entries into neutralized form.

Samir's jaw hardened. "A pruning daemon," he said. "It doesn't just hide. It comes in and rewrites indexes so later queries can't find what was chosen."

"Someone programmed the ship's memory not to remember certain things," Aya said. The implications sat heavy. A system that pruned memory was a system that could enforce narratives.

They executed the copy. The microdrive filled with compressed frames, telemetry, and a small but stubborn sequence that matched the prime intervals Aya had noticed. Samir made a small checksum printout — old tech printed on thermal strip — and fed the microdrive into an insulated container he'd carried in his jacket. Then they left as they'd come: hatches, clumsy footsteps, plausible maintenance traces.

When they reached the transit corridor, an unexpected gentle chime rose through the ship's network: an official notice that read with calm words.

"NOTICE: External beacon handshake detected. Please stand by for authorized diagnosis."

Aya felt the ship note them — not angry, not accusing, but aware. The message was general, but timing was everything. Just as they sealed the insulated drive and moved to a less monitored channel, her implant emitted a soft diagnostic whisper: a trace of handshake residues, encoded in a way that suggested deliberate intent rather than random telemetry.

"Prime intervals," she murmured. "Someone knocked. We answered."

Samir's face went flat. "We answered quietly," he said. "But they answered back." There was the sound in his voice of a door closing and another opening at the same time.

Aya's mind ticked forward: someone had left a marker, then someone had chosen to remove the marker from public memory, and the marker had chosen to speak back. The little knot of events made a new problem: the beacon wasn't inert; it responded. And someone — people, machines, policy — had arranged for that response to be selectively hidden.

They walked on toward a maintenance node where they could send the encrypted checksum to a trustworthy off-board contact, deciding to keep the microdrive physically close until they knew who could be trusted. The job they had done was small and fragile: a copy of an absence, an argument against forgetting.

When they parted ways in the dim corridors, both of them felt the quiet of the ship settle like snow. What they'd taken would matter, but the question of who else knew and who had set the watch would not go away. The ship would remember them in the logs it kept, but they hoped that the copies under their control would keep a memory someone else might need.
