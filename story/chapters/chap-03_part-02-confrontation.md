Elya ran a schematic ping and watched the lab's spectral lattice bloom. The reply came as a thin, patterned echo—less an answer and more an intimation: a set of harmonics that suggested purpose without offering words.

"There's structure here," she said. "It's not speech, but it's not noise. It reacts to specific pulse sequences."

They tried a different touch: a short, irregular knock in prime intervals. The echo folded and returned a longer pattern, then a directional nudge that unrolled like a tide across the instrument readout. It pointed not at a simple coordinate but along a vector that skirted mapped sectors and pushed toward uncharted folds in the lattice.

"Someone's teaching a map to tilt," Aya said. "This is beyond a single probe. It's signaling a route."

Across the net, a low-level command token flagged the vault's increased activity—an innocuous system notification that carried a timing that did not sit right with Samir. "Command logs a watch ping. They asked for an authorized diagnosis," he said. "That's a polite way to look."

The ship's notification was the kind of thing that put fingers on the scale: procedural, neutral-sounding, and final. If someone higher turned this into a 'mission safeguard', the evidence could be contained.

"Captain Ahn should see the sample," Samir said. "It's within chain-of-command."

Aya hesitated. The last time she took a straightforward report to command, things had been smoothed out—files pruned and memories anonymized. "If command is the filter, we risk losing what we found. If we go public too soon, it may be quarantined as a hazard."

The lab's door hissed as a non-comm message slid across Elya's console: an encrypted advisory, low priority, from a source outside the ship's immediate chain—an unknown node. It read like a warning and an invitation at once: "Do not escalate. Observe. Not everyone should see this."

Something else watched them now—not only the ship but an external actor with an interest in selective discovery. Aya felt the weight of the microdrive in her pocket like a second heartbeat. She had a fragment, a handshake, and a quiet message telling her to be cautious.

"Then we do what we must," Aya said. "We learn what the probe is calling and who it will let hear. Quietly."

Samir looked at the containment cradle and nodded. Outside, the lattice waited, indifferent and patient. The probe's hum was a promise of an answer that would cost them something to hear.

Elya's console chimed again with a low-priority advisory; its origin node traced back through a relay chain with soft obfuscation. The advisory read like counsel: "Observe. Do not escalate. Watchers respond poorly to broadcast." Whoever sent it knew how to be careful and how to keep others careful, too.

"Anonymous, low-priority—but deliberate," Elya said. "Someone with means and discretion sent that."

Aya considered the message. If it was a warning, it could be protection; if it was an instruction, it could be an attempt to control outcomes. Both possibilities ended in others shaping what the crew would remember.

"I'll keep a closed loop to trusted contacts," Aya said. "Lyra's network might corroborate if we've been watched before."

Samir tapped a secure note to an off-ship contact and then set the cradle into double-encryption. "We don't put it on general logs," he said. "We keep it stubborn and human; paper audit, encrypted drive, redundant hands."

A soft light at the edge of the observatory dome flickered—an external handshake acknowledgment, not from their own ship systems. The instrument readout showed a pulse signature that echoed the probe's pattern, but this time from a vectoring source on a slowly shifting bearing.

Elya's mouth went dry. "It's moving," she said. "It's not idle. It's repositioning."

The dome's lights dimmed as the sensors registered a faint, foreign Doppler trace. For a beat the ship felt small and watched.

"Prepare for approach," Aya ordered, voice steady but thin. "We follow this vector—and we decide who gets to know we followed it."

The sensor array registered a new micro-pulse—deliberately timed, impossibly precise—a reply to something they had not yet sent. The lab hold the breath of a crew on the edge of a decision; somewhere beyond the lattice an answer was forming, with implications they couldn't fully predict.
