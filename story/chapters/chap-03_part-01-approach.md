The propulsion hush of the Orion Ark settled into a watchful breath as they angled toward the vector the probe had suggested. Aya rode the observatory node with Samir at her shoulder—two people who listened for the small things that machines might call noise and people might call luck.

The array painted a ribbon of low-frequency variance across the sensors. In the middle of the smear sat a small, cold eddy: the probe-frag signature from the archives, now with a new micro-echo layered on top. It was faint, a pinprick of engineered noise that answered any coaxing with a polite, machine-timed blink.

"Frequency match is good," Elya said. She had the spectral lenses on; her hands moved with the patience of someone who treated data like brittle glass. "It's low-power, directional; it's trying to be seen without screaming."

Samir tuned a narrow sweep and the hull filled with a thin, almost musical hum—an artifact they couldn't help but feel as near enough to intention. The probe fragment spat back a short handshake when they nudged the vector: three clicks, a higher harmonic, then silence. The handshake wasn't friendly or hostile in any human sense; it was a function returning true.

"Someone set a marker and left a breadcrumb," Aya said. "But who'd seed a low-power observer and let it answer only when waved at?"

The fragment was small but not inert. Its casing had micro-grooves that read like manufacture marks, not local improv. Samir pinched a sample into a containment cradle, eyes shadowed. "Not our make," he said. "Not ours either."

They logged the fragment into the offline vault and wrapped the checksum for later distribution. Outside, the lattice shifted on their display—an opaque curve that bent instrument rays in subtly wrong ways. The probe's geometry suggested it had been placed to point, not patrol.

Aya kept thinking about the handshake: deliberate, quiet, controlled. Somebody wanted selected parties to find the probe. That meant someone controlled who learned and who didn't. The sense of being in a net tightened.

"Keep it local," Aya said. "No broadcast, no captain yet. We need more context than 'someone put a probe out there.'"

Elya's eyes stayed the machine's way. "I'll coax it again on a narrow channel. See if it replies to discrete pulses only. If it opens a pattern, we'll have more than a vector."

Samir stored the fragment in the padded cradle. "If it answers again, we decide whether it's an invitation or a test."

They collected the evidence the way archivists collect ruined letters: fragile, precious, and at risk of being smoothed out by more powerful hands. The ship hummed around them, and the small piece of metal sat in a cradle like a question.

A soft, anomalous ping flicked on the peripheral monitors—a microburst from beyond routine background. Samir frowned, fingers hovering over the console. "That wasn't our sweep," he said. "Something brushed the net while we were looking."

Aya felt the hairs at the back of her neck lift. The notion that another actor had briefly scanned the same patch shifted the situation from curiosity to surveillance. Whoever had put the probe in place might be watching who touched it—and that made every choice to probe, copy, or hold a move in a game someone else had started.

"Keep the cradle shielded," Aya ordered. "We don't let curiosity become evidence that can be collected. Not yet."
