# TL;DR
Planned 12-chapter arc: Aya and allies uncover deliberate erasure tied to an external beacon and internal watch process; a beacon handshake produces a probe and escalates conflict between exposing the truth and protecting the crew.

# Arc summary
The investigative plot line follows Aya tracing evidence, decoding the beacon, and approaching the dark lattice. The institutional plot line follows concealment, command decisions, and the politics of memory. Their intersection forces choices with crew safety and systemic transparency at stake.

# Chapters (status)
- chap-01 — Blank Sector (draft): Discovery of scrubbed sector and decision to bypass observatory.
- chap-02 — Prime Raps (draft): Observatory frames reveal a prime-interval beacon; evidence copied under watch.
- chap-03 — The Watch (planned): Archive watch process discovered; handshake initiated.
- chap-04 — Echoes (planned): Beacon responds; faint probe detected.
- chap-05 — Probe (planned): Analysis of probe yields partial decode and risks.
- chap-06 — Chain of Command (planned): Captain intervenes; orders vs disclosure.
- chap-07 — Leak (planned): Controlled leak and fallout; allies chosen.
- chap-08 — Pursuit (planned): Directional approach to lattice; systems fail intermittently.
- chap-09 — Contact (planned): Ambiguous contact; motives unclear.
- chap-10 — Lattice (planned): Structural study and direct hazard.
- chap-11 — Exposure (planned): Evidence surfaces or is suppressed; truth battle.
- chap-12 — Aftermath (planned): Consequences for ship, memory, and wider actors.

# Plot lines
- Investigation: Aya-led detection, evidence-gathering, decoding, close approach.
- Concealment & Authority: Watch processes, command choices, external pressure, suppression.

# Generation constraints & rules
- Use story/story_config.jsonc as authoritative for word counts, plot lines, and chapter counts.
- Auto-split chapters by plot_lines into ordered parts (chap-XX_part-YY-slug.md) when requested or when parts exceed configured word targets.
- Update metadata: on chapter/part create or edit, update chapter.last_updated, entry in revision_history, and the chapters array in this file.
- Maintain summaries at 20–70 words per chapter entry and list open threads explicitly for QA.

# Update workflow
- For every chapter edit, run: update plot.md (metadata & human summaries) → add revision_history note → run continuity checks against characters/locations/interaction logs → CI validate schema and cross-references.
